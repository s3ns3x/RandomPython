Things are better if I stay So long and goodnight So long and goodnight Came a time When every star fall Brought you to tears again We are the very hurt you sold And what's the worst you take From every heart you break And like the blade you'll stain Well I've been holding on tonight What's the worst that I can say? Things are better if I stay So long and goodnight So long and goodnight Well, if you carry on this way Things are better if I stay So long and goodnight So long and goodnight Can you hear me? Are you near me? Can we pretend to leave and then We'll meet again When both our cars collide What's the worst that I can say? Things are better if I stay So long and goodnightSo long and goodnight And if you carry on this way Things are better if I stay So long and goodnight So long and goodnight"
